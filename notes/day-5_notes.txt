	assumes that as if the request URl is being processed by the server
	points to the index,html
	forceRefresh props instead of pushState API in legacy browser
	this.props/props.history.push('/products')
	
HashRouter:
	uses client-side hash routing
	http://localhost:3000/#/products
	# portion of the URL will be used to keep the UI in sync with the URL
